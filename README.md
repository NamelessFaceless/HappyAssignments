# HappyAssignments
 FFXIV Text Overlay - Somewhat based on AngryAssignments from WoW, now you can write text on your screen to remind yourself of strategies, or your position for mechanics. Not exclusive to FFXIV since it doesn't hook into the game, but it's mainly the game it was made for. The development of the project is mostly done, the code is somewhat properly documented, but at some point I do plan on working some more on it.

 ## Usage
Open the executable, and you'll simply be able to load/save files, or, by pressing CTRL-F12, you'll be able to hide the window and only keep the text.

## Hotkeys
`CTRL + F12 - Show/Hide window form, keep text only.`

## Future Releases TODO
- Text Customization
- Hotkey Customization
- Better Interface
